        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Sarai Hernandez is currently a first year student at University of California, Riverside. Sarai is a Pre-Business Major and hopes to gain concentration in Marketing. She is seeking an entry-level position with an organization offering on the job training with opportunities for advancement. Sarai is well trained in Microsoft, Google Drive, and Mac. She also inherited the skills of being bilingual by being raised by two immigrant parents. She is excellent at multitasking, and quick to learn. Sarai has held many titles of leadership in past job positions, school leadership council, and in volunteering positions. Her past experiences of employment include: Liberty Tax, Arroyo Valley High School (San Bernardino City Unified School District), Splash Kingdom, Carlâ€™s Jr., and Redlands Chiropractic-Phillips White Chiropractic. Some of these positions which she filled while employed or attending these were: ASB Senior Class President at her past High School, Supervisor, English Learners Mentor, Student Intern. <br><br>

        From her past experiences she has picked up many skills. While working at Liberty Tax, her responsibilities were filing, sign waving, making appointments, and shredding papers. Since this was her first employment at the age of 14, she has learned what kind of working environment she enjoys and wants to be a part of in the future. Her following job was Splash Kingdom located in Redlands, Ca. Her responsibilities included: Guest Services, Ticket Sales, Cashier, Court Attendant, Communications, and Til Collecting. Here she used her Bilingual skills in communicating with many of the guests that attend the park. Along with Communications, she also developed a good sense of Customer Service and how to attend to issues between customers and employees. Her following work experience at Carlâ€™s Jr. exposed her to learn how to multitask. Her next position at Redlands Chiropractic brought her exposure to many new traits and work habits that she exemplifies at her new job. At Redlands Chiropractic she learned how to verify insurances, speak to attorneys regarding medical patients, fax, operate Maximizer, care for patients and utilize Hyperbolt before their visit with doctors, and great customer service towards medical patients. Sarai Hernandez now works for the San Bernardino City Unified School District at her previous high school, Arroyo Valley High School as a student intern and English Learner Mentor. She communicates and translates to the high school students. She also serves as a mentor to these students in grades 9-12th in their classes. She guides them in any issue that they may need help with on campus and focuses her attention on the students in their classes that are dual-lingo due to the fact that most of the time they have difficulty understanding English and need translation and understanding.<br><br>

        Sarai Hernandez connects online brands to their target audiences for the perfect marketing experience. At the University of California, Riverside, Sarai learned the importance of applying classic marketing techniques to modern brand strategies from experts in the field, including her Communications professor, Dr. Richey. Sarai is currently finishing her Bachelors in Marketing and hopes to intern in an online marketing department in the near future.
